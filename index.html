  <h2>Dear Sir/Madam</h2>
</div>
  <iv class="item">
  <p>I would like to take the opportunity to apply for an internship in IT.</p>
  <p>I currently live in the Netherlands. My children and I moved here from Ukraine because of the war.I feel a lot of support here and would like to be part of the working community to support myself and my children.</p>
  <p>I graduated from the Kyiv Transport University, where I received an engineering degree. But I was fascinated by working in an advertising agency, and I was good at it. I also put a lot of effort into studying social marketing. I am always looking for a new approach to develop my skills and work on process improvement.</p>
 <p> When I came to the Netherlands, I took a Web development course and found that programming completely captures and inspires me. Therefore, I try to devote every free minute to study programming and English in order to be able to work in this area.</p>
  <p>If you hire me as an intern, you find a quick learner, analytical team player who is highly motivated to learn new skills and is also happy to share knowledge with the team.</p>
<p>My power is to delve into details and look for optimization opportunities, working with full dedication.
Thank you very much for considering my resume.
  </p>
  <h3>Sincerely,<br/>
    Natalia Kokidko</h3>
